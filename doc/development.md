## Exacto Development

### Algorithms Phase (Play legal games)

1. Get movegen working by regressing over previous version
2. Basic evaluate
3. Search, QSearch
4. Time management
5. Deeper evaluate

### Heuristics Phase (ELO 2000)

1. Null move
2. LMR
3. Possibly move ordering
4. Better evaluate function

### ML Phase (Progress)

1. Move ordering / evaluate (quality of a move in a given position)
2. Tree pruning / time management (how necessary is it to search deeper)

(But perhaps these should be four separate problems.)
