## exacto

My name is Daniel Sparks and this is Exacto. Exacto is a chess program that I have worked on sporadically throughout the years. Versions up to and including 0.d are written around the basic source of 0.a, which operated on the "0x88" board representation. Starting with 0.e, Exacto uses the "bitboard" representation.

I invite you to download my program, look at the source code, play against it or have your own program play against it. I particularly invite your comments, which could in turn help me to improve Exacto.
